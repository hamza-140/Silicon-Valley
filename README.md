# Silicon Valley Companies to Watch This Year

As the world’s tech powerhouse, Silicon Valley embodies more than a geographic location. It’s the amalgamation of some of our most powerful ideas, carving its name into the interior of our global economy. The region has planted some of the most profitable seeds of intellect and transformation we've ever seen. Since the ascent of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, widely regarded as the “birth of Silicon Valley,” the area's population has grown tremendously. Today, millions of people call the region home, as tech companies continue to monopolize on the area’s overwhelming brainpower.

Spanning the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, cities in Silicon Valley encompass many of the world’s tech leaders. While Cupertino houses Apple’s headquarters, Mountain View boasts Googleplex. In Redwood City, Oracle and Box lead the competition, while San Jose plays host to tech giants like Cisco and Adobe. And as new startups continue to multiply, the region will add more names to its long list of world-renowned tech residents.
